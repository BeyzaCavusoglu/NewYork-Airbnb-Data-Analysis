# NewYork Airbnb Data Analysis
New York Airbnb hosts price analysis by their proximity to Wi-Fi hotspots and Point of Interests

Introduction & Problem Definition :

The main purpose of the project is to rank the Airbnb hosts in New York City based on their proximity to touristic points of interest and Wi-Fi Hotspot locations. The goal is trying to answer several questions by analyzing New York City Airbnb Open Data which can be listed as:

If the Airbnb host has more number of Wi-Fi hotspots around it, does that affect the price getting higher?

If the Airbnb host has more number of points of interests around it, does that affect the price getting higher?

If the Airbnb host is closer to touristic points of interest, does that affect the price getting higher?

If the Airbnb host is closer to Wi-Fi hotspots, does that affect the price getting higher?

Before analyzing the data, the hypothesis was the Airbnb hosts which are closer to touristic points of interest and Wi-Fi Hotspot locations will have a higher price. In this proect, the goal is to show that this hypothesis is accurate. This project aims to help the people who use Airbnb to gain better insight about hosts and make their bookings accordingly.
